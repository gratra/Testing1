The Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebra. The following table lists the arithmetic operators -

Assume integer variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then -

Operator 	Description 	Example
+ (Addition) 	Adds values on either side of the operator. 	A + B will give 30
- (Subtraction) 	Subtracts right-hand operand from left-hand operand. 	A - B will give -10
* (Multiplication) 	Multiplies values on either side of the operator. 	A * B will give 200
/ (Division) 	Divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand. 	B / A will give 2
% (Modulus) 	Divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand and returns remainder. 	B % A will give 0
++ (Increment) 	Increases the value of operand by 1. 	B++ gives 21
-- (Decrement) 	Decreases the value of operand by 1. 	B-- gives 19
